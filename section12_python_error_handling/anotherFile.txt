That slepen al the night with open ye,        
So priketh hem nature in hir corages: 
Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages,	
And palmers for to seken straunge strondes, 
To ferne halwes, couthe  in sondry londes;	
And specially, from every shires ende	        
Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,	
The holy blisful martir for to seke,	
That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke. 	
Bifel that, in that sesoun on a day,
In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay

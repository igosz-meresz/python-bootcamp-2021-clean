WHAN that Aprille with his shoures soote 	
The droghte of Marche hath perced to the roote,	
And bathed every veyne in swich  licour,	
Of which vertu engendred is the flour;	
Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth	        
Inspired hath in every holt  and heeth	
The tendre croppes,  and the yonge sonne	
Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne, 	
And smale fowles maken melodye,
